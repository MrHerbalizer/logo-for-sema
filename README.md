# logo-for-sema
edited few logos for sema
Sema logo is off-white in color. Using the logo on bright mode/background made it less visible. So converted the svg code of logo to png and dropped a slight shadow to it.
The link can of these logos can be used while writing documentations.
If requested by moderators of sema projects, can make further changes to the logos.
